## Introduction

My name is Szymon and this is my story.

### Childhood

I was born in 1995 in a small town located northeast of Warsaw in Poland. I had pretty much regular childhood with no exceptions. As a nerdish person, I struggled over
my time at highschool, I was not good enough in sports and had some fatal love crushes as most of the teenagers have. During that time I did not know what to do in my life. I went through a period of depression and resignation of my life.

### Adolescence

After highschool had started chemistry studies at the Warsaw Military University of Technology, which caused me to run between my home and university wasting much of my free time. After unsuccessful exam session I decided to quit and get a job in nearby fast food chain restaurant. It was hard as I felt that I did not belong there, but still I needed to move on.

### Studies

During later summer of 2015 I started studies at Lodz University of Technology in a department of biotechnology. Which after 5 years I have graduated from with an engineer's diploma in technical biochemistry.

An important experience that I acquired was also internship in at the Intercollegiate Faculty of Biochemistry UG&MUG in Gdansk. I dealt with the process of purification of head shock proteins sHsp. It required me to be well organized and good time management skills.

During my final year (2019) I had started learning bioinformatics for the course of my diploma. The title of my thesis was "Short read _De novo_ assembling of plasmid sequences of Komagateibacter _xylinus_. I have chosen this topic to increase my competences in a field of genomics and to show myself that I new challenges are not a problem for me. During my thesis I had to learn theoretical background of DNA sequencing, using bioinformatic tools like [IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/), [SPAdes assembler](https://cab.spbu.ru/software/spades/), [Quast](https://quast.sourceforge.net/index.html) and learn linux, bash and python basics. This inspired me to continue my journey in a field of bioinformatics. I did not finish my master thesis, as staying at the university I would not learn practical knowledge, so I decided to move on yet again.

### Back to origins

After the studies I have moved back to my place of origin. I have started working in Children's Health Memorial Institute in Warsaw as a junior assistant biotechnologist in genetics department. My main tasks was to uncover genetic background of rare disease occurring in patients DNA in polish population. This enabled me to understand the **rare genetic variant classification** based on ACMG guidelines as well as skills in usage of NCBI ClinVar, SNP, OMIM, OrphaNet, HGMD, LOVD, UniProt, gnomAD, Reactome, HPO and other genetic databases. In my day-to-day job I was analyzing BAM and VCF files coming from NGS target sequencing as well as from Whole exome sequencing, fastqc statistics and cnv variants from CNVkit. As an aspiring bioinformatitian I was responsible for meritorious background of my team of geneticists and lab analysts in the method of target enrichment sequencing.

I was also responsible for writing a grant for IT infrastructure to the Ministry of Education and Science, which obtained financing for purchase of a disk array and computing servers for in house genomics platform. During that period I had learned how to work with clients (as we were a laboratory we had to deal with patients and doctors constantly).
